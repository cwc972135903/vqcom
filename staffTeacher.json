			<h2>Eric Segal
				<!-- <span>波士顿大学,博士</span>-->
			</h2>
			<p>Eric Segal is a 2005 graduate of Stanford University, where he studied mathematics (B.S.) and philosophy
				(B.A.). He later attended the Colorado School of Mines, earning an M.S. in Energy Economics in 2012 and
				receiving special recognition for outstanding performance. As evidenced by his educational background,
				Eric's interests and knowledge span a variety of subjects. His professional background is also
				wide-ranging, and includes experience as a legal assistant, research assistant, and management
				consultant. In these roles and others, his excellent written and spoken communication skills contributed
				greatly to his success.

				Eric recognizes that learning to speak a foreign language is difficult, and that learning to write in a
				foreign language can be even more challenging. He believes, however, that the reward is well worth the
				effort. Strong language proficiency enhances critical thinking skills and improves one's ability to
				clearly articulate thoughts, both to oneself and to others. For these reasons, he has worked diligently
				to improve his own communication skills, and he is excited about the opportunity to help others do the
				same.</p>

			<p>My academic background includes a B.A. degree in English from a top-ranking college, and an M.B.A. degree

				up in the U.S., so I speak English like a native. With an excellent command of the English language and
				very strong writing skills, I have helped many students, especially students from abroad, write better,
				more polished essays. I would be honored, and very happy, to use my writing and editing skills to help
				as many students as I can to achieve greater success in their academic careers, and to gain admission to

			<h2>Francesca Kennedy
				<!-- <span>波士顿大学,博士</span>-->
			</h2>
			<p>Francesca graduated from Harvard in 2018 with her bachelor's in History & Literature, where she focused
				on modernist poetry. She spent one year of her four-year degree studying at Oxford, and is therefore
				well-equipped to advise students on the difference between writing styles that would best suit each
				educational system. Armed with her personal writing motto, Prose But Not Prosaic, her creative writing
				has been published in the Harvard Advocate, the oldest arts and literary magazine in the USA, and
				Oxford's equivalent, the Isis Magazine. A graduate of America's oldest high school, Boston Latin, where
				she studied Latin for six years, she translated her own version of the Aeneid, competed nationally in
				Latin quiz bowls, won several prestigious awards including the Columbia Book Prize, and visited
				twenty-five countries. A voracious essay-reader and editor and currently finishing a novel herself, an
				early excerpt of which won the H. G. Wells Short Story Competition and was subsequently published in its
				anthology, she has ample experience weaving together the joys of fiction with the persuasiveness of
				academic writing. Having just returned from her year at Oxford, where her work was deemed
				"eye-wateringly impressive" by the head of her college's English department, she looks forward to
				helping other students put their best foot forward for their chosen colleges. She has been working as an
				private essayist and tutor for many years, and has helped her clients successfully receive offers from a
				number of highly selective US and British universities and high schools.</p>
